# Password Manager

## What will it do?

This application will save usernames, passwords and other credentials for websites for different user.

## Who Will use it?

People who have a lot of passwords to remember or who simply 
have trouble remembering will use it as an easy way to store this information

## Why is this project of interest to you

Cybersecurity has been something that I've been quite interested in recently. I took a Cybersecurity course at 
Langara previously so wanted to do something that could incorporate what I learned in that course with.
